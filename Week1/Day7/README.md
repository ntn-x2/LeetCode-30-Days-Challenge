# Day 7, 07/04/2020 - Counting Elements

Given an integer array `arr`, count element `x` such that `x + 1` is also in `arr`.

If there're duplicates in `arr`, count them seperately.

**Example 1**:

<code>
Input: arr = [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
</code>

**Example 2**:

<code>
Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]

Output: 0

Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there's no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
</code>

**Example 3**:

<code>
Input: arr = [1,3,2,3,5,0]

Output: 3

Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are counted cause 1, 2 and 3 are in arr.
</code>

**Example 4**:

<code>
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2]

Output: 2

Explanation: Two 1s are counted cause 2 is in arr.
</code>

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

**Hint 1**

Use hashset to store all elements.

**Hint 2**

Loop again to count all valid elements.
